# chatter

This is a tutorial I learn from @HayesGordon. Thanks so much. 

Some items I added and changed;
1. Button navbar 
In the android version (smaller screens) it moves completely
down so I added a padding bottom of 8.0

2. Chat Screen
   (i) Set the textfield maxLine value to null, so the message
    text will wrap down.
   (ii)
